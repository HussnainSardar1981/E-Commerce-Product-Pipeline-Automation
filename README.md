# E-Commerce-Product-Pipeline-Automation
Built a fully automated pipeline that scrapes unstructured product albums from a Chinese image-hosting site, uses visual search AI to detect original product brands (e.g., Nike, Gucci), fetches metadata from official sites, rewrites content with AI, and uploads complete listings (images, title, description) to a custom Shopify store.
